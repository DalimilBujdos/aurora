\arguments{
\item{pheno_mat}{Data frame that contains unique indexes in the first column
and the phenotype classes in the second column. The unique indexes
should contain only letters, numbers and special signs "_", ".". The maximum number of unique classes is 9.}

\item{bin_mat}{Binary matrix containing the genomic variants. See \code{type_bin_mat} to check what can be supplied as a binary matrix.}

\item{type_bin_mat}{Specifies the type of binary matrix. Options are: "panaroo"|"roary"; Exact system path to a csv file containing a pangenome matrix
in Roary format (gene_presence_absence_roary.csv) or the pangenome matrix loaded as data frame. The pangenome in this format is produced by both Roary and Panaroo.
"DRAM"; Exact system path to a file containing the summary of metabolism produced by DRAM (metabolism_summary.xlsx). "SCARAP"; Exact system path to a file pangenome.tsv
or a dataframe containing the results of a pangenome tool SCARAP. "custom"; Data frame or matrix containing custom binary matrix. The features should be in columns and the strains in rows.
"k-mers"|"unitigs"; Exact system path to a .gz file containing unitigs called by unitig-counter or k-mers by fsm-lite. "PIRATE"; Exact system path to a file containing the pangenome
produced by PIRATE (PIRATE.gene_families.tsv) or the pangenome loaded as a dataframe. "SNPs"; Exact system path to a VCF file. aurora expect these columns:
#CHROM, POS, ID, REF, ALT, QUAL, FILTER, INFO, FORMAT and a column for each analysed strain.}

\item{which_snps}{There are two options: "biallelic" and  "all_alleles". Setting which_snps = "biallelic" will remove all SNPs that
have more than one alternative allele. Setting which_snps = "all_alleles" will create a new column for every alternative allele.}

\item{bagging}{Bagging algorithm applied to capture the population structure.
Select from "random_walk" or "phylogenetic_walk". Default: "phylogenetic_walk".}

\item{tree}{Phylogenetic tree loaded as an object of class \code{Phylo}. The tree needs to contain
edge lengths and the tips should be the same as the indexes in pheno_mat.}

\item{alternative_dist_mat}{Distance matrix that contains pairwise phylogenetic
distances. Row names and column names needs to be the same
as indexes in \code{pheno_mat}.}

\item{reduce_outlier}{If TRUE the phylogenetic distances of very distant strains
to the rest of the population will be reduced. Default: TRUE.}

\item{cutoff_outlier}{The number of standard deviations to the right of the mean
of the distance distribution. Distances with z-score higher than the cutoff
will be shrunk to the cutoff. Default: 3.}

\item{fit_parameters}{Indicates if parameters to AdaBoost and Random Forest should be fitted.
Default: TRUE.}

\item{repeats}{Number of times the parameters are fitted. Default: 10.}

\item{random_forest}{Indicates whether to use Random Forest. Default: TRUE.}

\item{plot_random_forest}{Indicates if the distance matrix from Random Forest
should be plotted. Default: TRUE.}

\item{sampsize}{Determines the size of the random sample used to build each tree in Random Forest.
Default: 50. Ignored if \code{fit_parameters} = TRUE.}

\item{mtry}{Controls the number of features considered at each split during
tree building in Random Forest. Default: 200. Ignored if \code{fit_parameters} = TRUE.}

\item{ntree}{Determines the number of trees in Random Forest. Default: 100. Ignored if \code{fit_parameters} = TRUE.}

\item{maxnodes}{Limits the maximum number of terminal nodes in each Random Forest tree. Default: 12. Ignored if \code{fit_parameters} = TRUE.}

\item{ovr_log_reg}{Indicates whether to use log regression with one vs rest strategy.
Default: TRUE.}

\item{C_val}{Regularization term for l1 penalty in log regression. Default: 0.5.}

\item{adaboost}{Indicates whether to use AdaBoost. Default: TRUE.}

\item{max_depth}{Indicates the maximum depth of the decision tree in AdaBoost. Default: 1.
Changing the value will not effect anything. It is only here because
in future version the user will be able to experiment with it.}

\item{n_estimators}{Determines the number of weak learners to combine in AdaBoost. Default: 500. Ignored if \code{fit_parameters} = TRUE.}

\item{learning_rate}{Controls the contribution of each weak learner in the final AdaBoost model. Default: 0.3. Ignored if \code{fit_parameters} = TRUE.}

\item{CART}{Indicates whether to use classification and regression tree (CART) model. Default: TRUE.}

\item{CART_plot}{Indicates whether the proximities from CART models
should be plotted. Default: TRUE.}

\item{condaenv_path}{An exact system path to a conda environment that will be used for log regression and
AdaBoost. If no path is provided or if the path is set to NA then AdaBoost and log
regression will not be run.}

\item{low_perc_cutoff}{The lower cutoff for filtering the supplied binary matrix. Default = 3.
This means that all features present in less than 3\% of all strains will be removed.}

\item{upp_perc_cutoff}{The upper cutoff for filtering the supplied binary matrix. Default = 99.
This means that all features present in more than 99\% of all strains will be removed.}

\item{run_chisq}{Indicates whether chi-square filter should be run. Use only if the number of features after
the initial filtering is still large (> 10,000). Default: FALSE.}

\item{cutoff_chisq}{A cutoff p-value for the chi-square test. Features with p-value
higher that the cutoff will be removed. Default: 0.1.}

\item{jaccard_filter}{Grouping of correlated features based on Jaccard distance matrix and DBSCAN.
Default: FALSE. Only one grouping method (\code{jaccard_filter} or \code{hamming_filter})
can be used.}

\item{minPts_val}{\code{minPts} parameter in DBSCAN. Specifies the minimum number of neighboring data
points for a point to be considered a core point. Default: 3.}

\item{eps_val}{\code{eps} parameter in DBSCAN. Determines the maximum distance between two points
for them to be considered neighbors. Default: 0.01.}

\item{hamming_filter}{Grouping of correlated features based on Hamming distance.
Default: TRUE. Only one grouping method (\code{jaccard_filter} or \code{hamming_filter})
can be used.}

\item{hamming_cutoff}{Maximum Hamming distance. If features have intrarcluster
distances lower or equal to hamming_cutoff then they are grouped
into one feature. Default: 3.}

\item{ancest_rec_filter}{Indicates if ancestral reconstruction filter should be used.
The filter removes features broadly distributed along the
phylogenetic tree. These features are often common plasmid genes
and IS elements. Default: TRUE.}

\item{cutoff_asr}{The number of standard deviations to the right of the mean
of the distribution produced by ancest_rec_filter. Features
with z-score higher than the cutoff will be removed. Default: 2.}

\item{bag_size}{The size of the bag for each class. Default: NA. If NA than the
bag_size is calculated as 5* the number of strains in the class
with the fewest strains. Provide the size as a number for each class
i.e., c(50, 50, 50) for a phenotype with three classes.}

\item{no_rounds}{Number of times the aurora algorithm iterates. Default: 100. You can decrease
this number to lower the computational time}

\item{max_per_bag}{Maximum number of times a strain can be repeated in the bag. Default: NA
If NA than the max_per_bag is calculated so that none of the strains
exceeds 20\% of the bag of each class.}

\item{misslabel_no}{The number of mislabeled strains in the threshold calculation
phase. Default: 1. Do not modify this argument. In the future
version the user will be able to experiment with this.}

\item{write_data}{Indicates whether aurora should write the data in a directory specified
by an argument \code{save_dir}. Default: TRUE.}

\item{save_dir}{An exact system path to the directory where the result will be written.}
}
\value{
The output is a nested list that mainly contains a table for each ML tool.
The tables show which strains were identified as autochthonous and allochthonous.
The list also contains p-value matrices that show if the entire species is adapted
to the investigated phenotype.
