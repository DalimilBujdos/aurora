This vignette demonstrates how to set up conda environment for *aurora*. This will allow you to use log regression and AdaBoost in function `aurora_pheno()`. The function that sets up the environment (`setup_conda()`) has no input and only one output which is the path to the conda environment. This path then has to be specified in function `aurora_pheno()`.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(aurora)
# set up conda environment using packaged .yaml file
conda_path <- setup_conda() # make sure that the path is in this format: /path/to/dir

# now you can use the path in aurora_pheno() and log regression and AdaBoost will be run
results <- aurora_pheno(pheno_mat = pheno_mat,
                        bin_mat = bin_mat,
                        tree = tree,
                        condaenv_path = conda_path,
                        save_dir = "/path/to/save/dir")

```
