Description: The microbial population from a given habitat contains autochthonous microbes
 (i.e., able to form a stable colony) and microbes that are allochthonous which cannot form
 a stable colony. This fact complicates the analysis of adaptation strategies towards the
 habitat because the allochthonous strains represent mislabelled observations. This package
 aims to highlight microbial strains whose origin is NOT in the analyzed habitat and likewise
 microbialstrains who likely CAN survive in the habitat but were isolated from another source.
 Additionally, aurora's GWAS approach operates without the presumption that the trait did not impact the phylogeny.
